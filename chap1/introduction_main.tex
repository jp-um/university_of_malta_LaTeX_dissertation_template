\subsection{Showing the Use of Acronyms}

In the early nineties, \acs{GSM} was deployed in many European countries. \ac{GSM} offered for the first time international roaming for mobile subscribers. The \acs{GSM}’s use of \ac{TDMA} as its communication standard was debated at length. And every now and then there are big discussion whether \ac{CDMA} should have been chosen over \ac{TDMA}.

If you want to know more about \acf{GSM}, \acf{TDMA}, \acf{CDMA} and other acronyms, just read a book about mobile communication. Just to mention it: There is another \ac{UA}, for testing.
