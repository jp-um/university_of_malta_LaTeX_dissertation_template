\chapter{Evaluation}

In an ideal world, you should have two kind of evaluations. The first is against some ground truth (perhaps a random model?). The second kind of evaluation is against other people's work (accuracy, speed, etc.). Any dimension which is of interest, should be evaluated.  Evaluation should be statistically sound.
