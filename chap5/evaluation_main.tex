\chapter{Evaluation}

\textbf{In an ideal world, you should have two kind of evaluations.  The first is against some ground truth (perhaps a random model?).  The second kind of evaluation is against other people's work (accuracy, speed, etc.).  Any dimension which is of interest, should be evaluated.  Evaluation should be statistically sound. }
