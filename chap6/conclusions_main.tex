\chapter{Conclusions}

This section should have a summary of the whole project.  The original aims and objective and whether these have been met should be discussed. It should include a section with a critique and a list of limitations of your proposed solutions.  Future work should be described, and this should not be marginal or silly (e.g.\ add machine learning models).  It is always good to end on a positive note (i.e.\ `Final Remarks').
